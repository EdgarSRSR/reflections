When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to do that if you are working on a project with a more than one person, also if you want to create changes from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because that way you have more control over what is committed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is used to work with a project that someone else made and uploaded to github, a clone is used to 'download' a project into the local repository, it can be a clone from a fork. The branches are used to test different characteristics of a same project in your local repository.
